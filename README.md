Salary Data Analysis
This project involves analyzing salary data using Python and R. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. This README file provides detailed instructions on how to use the provided scripts.

1. Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

For Python
Python 3.7 or higher
Required libraries:
pandas
Install the libraries using:

bash

Copy

Edit

pip install pandas

For R

R (version 4.0 or higher)

Required packages:

ggplot2

dplyr

tidyr

Install the R packages using:


R
Copy
Edit
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
2. Files in the Repository
Python Script
script.py: Python script for loading the dataset, cleaning data, performing analysis, and generating visualizations.
R Script
script.R: R script for performing similar data analysis and visualizations using R.
Dataset
salaries.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
Generated Output
Visualizations: The Python and R scripts generate plots and save them in the working directory.
3. Running the Python Script
Ensure the dataset (salaries.csv) is in the same directory as script.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing script.py.
Run the script using:
bash
Copy
Edit
python script.py
Outputs:
The script will generate descriptive statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar plots).
Saved visualizations will be in the current working directory.
4. Running the R Script
Ensure the dataset (salaries.csv) is in the same directory as script.R.
Open RStudio and load the script.R script.
Set the working directory to the folder containing the dataset:
R
Copy
Edit
setwd("path/to/your/directory")
Source the script by running:
R
Copy
Edit
source(“script.R”)
Outputs:
The R script will generate similar descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Saved visualizations will be in the current working directory.
5. Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing and duplicated data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the distribution of salaries, job titles, and other key metrics.
Visualizations:
Bar plots for salary comparisons.
Histograms for salary distributions.
Aggregated data summaries.
6. Customization
For Python: Modify the script.py file to adjust visualizations or add new analysis.
For R: Edit the script.R file to add additional plots or summary statistics.
7. Troubleshooting
Ensure the salaries.csv file is formatted correctly and matches the column names used in the scripts.
If any library is missing, install it using the provided installation commands.
